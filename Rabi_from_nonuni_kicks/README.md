# Rabi_from_nonunitary_kicks
A single-script repo with a few-line example showing that a coherent quantum evolution can be synthesized by nonunitary fluctuations.

This is a simple example showing that a coherent Rabi oscillation can be generated by the stochastic
application of the Kraus operators 

$K_{\pm} = 1/\sqrt{2} (1 \mp \Gamma \sigma_{\pm} dt)$ (nonunitaries)

where $\sigma_{\pm}$ is the lowering and higher operators of a two-level quantum system.

The code takes a pure state $|\psi\rangle$
and evolves it as

$|\psi (t+dt)\rangle = K_t |\psi(t)\rangle$/norm

in density matrix form, this reads

$\rho(t+dt) =  K_t  \rho(t) K_t^{\dagger} / Tr (K_t  \rho(t) K_t^{\dagger}) $

The state is at all times pure, and it corresponds to the realization of a single quantum trajectory.

Operators $K_t$ is sampled from $(K_+,K_-)$ with probabilities 
$p_{\pm} = \langle \psi(t) |K_{\pm}^{\dagger} K_{\pm} |\psi(t)\rangle$.
As $dt\rightarrow 0$, the single stochastic nonunitary trajectory becomes deterministic and unitary.
The equation of motion emerging is the Schrodinger equation:

$\partial_t |\psi\rangle = -i(\Gamma/2)\sigma_y |\psi\rangle.$

or identically for the density matrix

$\partial_t \rho = -i \Gamma/2 [\sigma_y,\rho].$
